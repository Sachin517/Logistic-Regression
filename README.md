# Logistic-Regression

Predicting the customers who will churn or not checking the current data and the variables affecting that
-  Checked for the NULL Values or Outliers
- Transformed the Categorical data into Numerical data by using DUmmies 
-  Done with RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) to get the best variables
- Started with the optimal cut off of 0.5 and checked the Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specifitivity
- After that checked the ROC -  AUC curve to find the best optimal cut off for the model where we can get Accuracy, Specitivity and Sensitivity similar
- Created model again with the the optimal cut off and evaluated the model.
